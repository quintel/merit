  # Terminology:
  #
  #   "always-on"  - Producers which must always be running, and therefore
  #                  demand / load is assigned to these first.
  #
  #   "transients" - The opposite of an always-on producer, these may be
  #                  turned on and off as necessary in order to fulfil any
  #                  demand which cannot be provided by an always-on producer.

  # This works on the principle that days which are close to one another are
  # expected to have very similar load characteristics; it is unlikely that
  # wind turbines will be in high demand on January 1st, but low demand on the
  # following day.
  #
  # This calculator computes only a subset of days in the year, and then
  # copies the results for those days into the following few days. For
  # example, with a resolution of 3, it will compute the results for January
  # 1st, then use the same figures for January 2nd and 3rd. January 4th will
  # then be computed, with its values being used for the 5th and 6th.
  #
  # The result is that we're able to skip a large number of extra calculations
  # with only a very small loss of accuracy. "Freak occurrences" in the load
  # curves (such as an unusually high load in one particular hour, on one day
  # of the year) may be lost or exaggerated depending on whether they happen
