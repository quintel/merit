      Frame = Struct.new(:index, :value)

      # Runs the optimization calculating how much will be stored in each hour.
      #
      # The algorithm works like so:
      #
      # 1. Order all hours from lowest value (load) to highest.
      # 2. Pop the highest hour.
      # 3. Search in earlier hours (as far as `lookbehind` specifies) for the hour where the value
      #    is lowest. An hour is only selected if its value is 95% or lower than the highest hour
      #    value. This reduces the number of iterations by avoiding many small charges/discharges.
      # 4. Place a charge in the low hour (min) and a discharge in the high hour (max).
      #
      # The charge/discharge in step 4 has several constraints:
      #
      # * The available battery volume between the min and max hours.
      # * The remaining input capacity in the min hour and output capacity in the max hour.
      # * One quarter of the difference in value between the min and max hour.
      #
      # Rather than equalizing the load of the two hours (`(max - min) / 2`), we assign at most one
      # quarter of the difference as this allows energy to be "spread" more fairly across many
      # hours. Not doing this tends to reduce the absolute peak hours while leaving the surrounding
      # hours unaffected. Changing this constant (for example, to one tenth of the difference) can
      # produce smoother, flatter curves at the expensive of increased run-time. One quarter was
      # found to be a good compromise for real-world curves.
